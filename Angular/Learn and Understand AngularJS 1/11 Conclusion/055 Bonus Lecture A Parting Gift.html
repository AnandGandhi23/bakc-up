Such skill can also help you in other Javascript-based technologies such as NodeJS, and many others.</p><p>To help you with that, I wanted to leave you with a coupon for my nearly 12-hour advanced Javascript course entitled "Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts", that will help you greatly improve your Javascript skills by understanding how Javascript works 'under the hood'. This course is normally $149, but here is a link to get it for $19:</p><p><a class="external-link" href="https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/?couponCode=JA19" rel="nofollow noreferrer" style="" target="_blank">https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/?couponCode=JA19</a><br style=""></p><p>or just use the coupon code JA19. You can also watch the first two sections of the course for free. The course covers a wide range of topics, such as <strong style="">first-class functions, callbacks, closures, functional programming, prototypal inheritance, and new features in the next version of Javascript</strong>. We also dive into the source code of jQuery to see what we can learn, and finish off by <strong style="">building your own mini-framework/library</strong>! Use the link above if you are interested.</p><p>Whether you are interested or not, thank you again for being a student!</p>
