            <p>From this point forward most lectures will contain <strong style="">downloadable source code</strong>. The code gives you both a place to start, and completed code.</p><p>When you are watching a lecture you can find the code by clicking 'View resources' (in the upper right of the screen). <em style="">If that lecture has code available</em>, a zip file will be listed that you can then download.</p><p>After downloading the zip file, you can extract (i.e. unzip) it and you will find two folders. One is called '<em style="">Starter</em>', which contains code to use as starter code so you can follow along with the lecture. The other folder is called '<em style="">Finished</em>' and contains the completed code from the end of the lecture for you to study and compare to your own code.</p>
